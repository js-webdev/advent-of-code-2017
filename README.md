# Advent of Code 2017 - [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

I'm new to Python and I think the Advent of Code is a good thing to get into it a bit.
I'll try to solve the puzzles daily and push it up here.

## Day 1: Inverse Captcha

Got it right! A little more Code than others, but at least it works ;)

## Day 2: Corruption Checksum

It works fine, maybe a little more code than really needed - especially compared to [this guy](https://github.com/kodsnack/advent_of_code_2017/blob/master/erikdyrelius-python3/Day02.py)

## Day 3: Spiral Memory

That's a really tough one - for me. Got a good hint from the [subred entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7h7ufl/2017_day_3_solutions/#thing_t1_dqovw0z)
For part 2 I just looked it up on [OEIS](https://oeis.org/A141481)

## Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases

Seemed pretty easy at first sight, but it turned out to be not as easy in a new Language :D
In the end I started looking up stuff on GitHub from other folks who did it in Python and copied it.
But at least i got to know a real quick and awesome way to solve it.

## Day 5: A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike

Finally something for me again ;)
Pretty easy to solve in Python, or any other language i guess.

## Day 6: Memory Reallocation

That was a really, really nice task to do.
Not very difficult but with a lot of posibillities to write mistakes.
