# Advent of Code 2017 - [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

I'm new to Python and I think the Advent of Code is a good thing to get into it a bit.
I'll try to solve the puzzles daily and push it up here.

## Day 1: Inverse Captcha

Got it right! A little more Code than others, but at least it works ;)

## Day 2: Corruption Checksum

It works fine, maybe a little more code than really needed - especially compared to [this guy](https://github.com/kodsnack/advent_of_code_2017/blob/master/erikdyrelius-python3/Day02.py)

## Day 3: Spiral Memory

That's a really tough one - for me. Got a good hint from the [subred entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7h7ufl/2017_day_3_solutions/#thing_t1_dqovw0z)
For part 2 I just looked it up on [OEIS](https://oeis.org/A141481)
